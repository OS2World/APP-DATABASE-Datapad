/*************************** INSTALLATION ***************************/

   PADHD has no installation program.  It consists of four files - PADHD.EXE,
PADHD.HLP, WHATS.NEW, and ORDER.FRM.  After you unzip it, copy 
PADHD.EXE and PADHD.HLP to a utilities directory or where ever you want 
them to reside.  The file ORDER.FRM is an order form to register PADHD and
can be easily printed to make registering an easy and almost painless chore.
The file WHATS.NEW is an ASCII text file that summarizes the new 
features/changes.
   Migrate PADHD to the desk top or use a program template to put an icon 
on the desktop for it.  Or you could run it from the command line to test it.  
Whatever serves your purpose.  After you run it the first time it will create 
three other files in the directory where it resides.  The data file that holds
the info on your notes ( you'll be prompted for a name ),  PADHD.INI is an 
initiation data file that holds settings and screen coordinates. PADHD.DAT is
a data file that stores the name of the .PDF files on your search list.  
   You can run multiple copies of PADHD on your system.  They should be 
located in different directories or drives.  Every copy will run off of its own
.ini and .dat files.

/************************* NEW STUFF ver. 2.0 *************************/

1. Partially resizable Edit/View/Add/Search screens.   These windows are redesigned
   to be partially resizable.  Some of the functions that had previously been available
   as buttons are NOW on pop-up menus associated with the text areas ( MLE box )
   of each screen.  Pop-up menus are accessed by putting the mouse pointer on top
   of the text area and clicking the right mouse button once.

2. Users can now select the fixed length record size of their data files.  Each data
   file can be set for a fixed length record size between 1-30k.  Each data file can
   be different - they all do NOT need to have the same fixed length record.  The
   fixed length record size of a data file CAN also be reset AFTER it is created.
   For example :  You have a data file RECIPES.PDF and it was created to have
   5k fixed length records.  You have put 135 records in the data file.  You notice
   that the largest amount of text in any of those records is ONLY 2.5k.  You can
   then resize the entire data file to have 3k records - thus saving disk space.
   You could also resize the data file upwards to any fixed length record size 
   between 3-30k.  It is similar in conception to a popular OS/2 program called
   Partition Magic which allows resizing of hard disk partitions.  PadHD allows
   resizing of its data files and their fixed length record size.

3. Print output will now reflect the Word Wrap state of the record.  If you have
   word wrap enabled and 'scrunch' the window up real narrow and press the
   print button the text output will reflect the same line breaks you see on the
   screen.

4. Ability to set EDIT screen as default 'double click' choice from main list box.

5.  Simple Date/Time stamp for records.

6.  Simple function to Copy/Move records between .PDF files.  ( main screen pop-up )  

7.  Limited font/color support for main screen list box.  ( main screen pop-up )    

8.  Numerous other small bug fixes and design changes.

/************************* ALMOST THE END *************************/

   Registration is a paltry $35.00.  Upon registration you'll receive a postcard with the 
appropriate code to get rid of the ugly Shareware "About PADHD" screen.  Upgrades 
or bug fixes will of course be posted on Several BBS's and the Hobbes site on the
internet.  All current users of course can still use their same code words on this or 
ANY future updates.  Suggestions for new features or comments may be sent to the 
address below or posted on the internet ========>  hkypuck@ibm.net
