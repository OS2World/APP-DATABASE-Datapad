WHAT IS PADHD
   PADHD ver. 1.1 is a "scratch pad" to jot notes in and organize small files into.
While PADHD is NOT a WORD PROCESSOR It has several features to help make man-
aging notes a lot easier - such as cut, clear, copy, paste, search, save to ASCII,
import ASCII file, and an ASCII dump to the printer.  At its simplest it is merely a 
note pad.  At it's most it is a great note organizer for students, teachers, programmers
( source code files and examples ), and any one with a lot of information to handle.
PADHD will keep up to 1000 records, each 29,999 bytes long, per data file.  There
can be an unlimited number of data files, so the amount that can be stored is un-
limited.  Each data file will grow and/or shrink as you add or delete records.  Their
size is not static.  Find notes, source code, or any info when you need it, then copy
and paste into almost any program to use it!  Pad can save you hours of time search-
ing your hard drive for files and makes it easy to organize!

INSTALLING PADHD
   PADHD has no installation program.  It consists of four files - PADHD.EXE ,
PADHD.DOC, WHATS.NEW, and ORDER.FRM.  After you unzip it, copy PADHD.EXE and 
PADHD.DOC to a utilities directory or where ever you want them to reside.  If you 
don't need the doc files, they may be erased but the PADHD.DOC file is used by the 
Help selection on the Menu Bar.  If you do erase it, you will not be able to call it 
through using Help.  The file ORDER.FRM is an order form to register PADHD and can 
be easily printed to make registering an easy and almost painless chore.  The file
WHATS.NEW is an ASCII text file that summarizes the new features/changes.
   Migrate PADHD to the desk top or use a program template to put an icon on the
desktop for it.  Or you could run it from the command line to test it.  Whatever serves
your purpose.  When you run it for the first time it will ask you to type in the directory
where the program files will be located at.  If, for instance, you have put PADHD.EXE 
and PADHD.DOC in the C:\PADHD directory - type in the complete path when prompted.
Actually, you can type in any VALID path but most people will want the associated data
and initialization files in the same directory as the program.  If you type in the WRONG
path and want to change it later, just erase the PADHD.INI and PADHD.DAT files and
start over again.
   After you run it the first time it will create three other files in the same directory.  
PADHD.PDF is the default data file that holds the info on your notes.  PADHD.INI is an 
initiation data file that holds settings and screen coordinates.  PADHD.DAT is a data 
file that stores the name of the .PDF files on your search list.  
   You probably should run only one copy of PADHD on your system.  When you first
start PADHD and it prompts you for a path - that path is stored in your OS2.INI file.
Every time you start PADHD it reads your OS2.INI file and retrieves that path.  That is
where the program looks for the PADHD.DAT and PADHD.INI file.  If you ran another
copy of PADHD in another directory or drive it would still look to the path in the OS2.INI
file.  So, if you want to move PADHD from one directory or drive to another be sure
to erase the 'old' copy AND DON'T COPY THE PADHD.INI AND PADHD.DAT files to the 
new directory.  The program will create new ones for you. Then when you start it in it's
new home it will prompt you again for a new path string.

USING PADHD
   Using PADHD should be rather simple and I hope intuitive.  That's primarily
why it was written.  Double click on the PADHD icon and after you see the noxious
shareware screen and you will see the main screen appear.  You are presented with
a list box which will show a list of your notes and six push buttons that will
perform various tasks.  Of course, when you first start with PADHD there are not any
records listed.  The first, obvious, thing to do is to use the Add button and create some
records or import some ASCII files - either through the menu selection Import File or
by simply dropping a text file directly on top the MAIN screen list box..

/******************** Controls on Main Screen ***************************/

QUIT   :  Rather obvious function.  It ends the program.

VIEW   :  Strictly for viewing - double clicking on the name of the record in
           the list box will also activate the View window.  Copy, Search, Export, and
           Print controls are available in the View Window.

EDIT   :  Edit a note and change it's content.  Notes can be copied or imported
           from the clip board, imported from an ASCII file, or typed in.  Copy, Paste,
           Cut, Clear, Print, Search, and Import/Export controls are available in the
           Edit Window.

ADD    :  Use this to start a new note. Up to 1000 notes per data file.  Copy, Paste,
           Cut, Clear, and Import controls are available in an Add Window.

SEARCH : Use this to search through the text or name part of the notes for specific
           words or phrases.  This global search button will search through all records
           and find any occurrences of your search string.  It can also search through
           multiple ( up to 25 ) .PDF modules.

DELETE :  Destroy the note and remove it from the data file.

   When you first start the program, of course, you have no notes.  So the first push
button you'll use is the ADD function. ( alternately you could use the Import File sel-
ection on the menu bar to directly import ANY size ASCII directly into the .PDF file
or use direct manipulation and DROP an ASCII file onto the MAIN screen list box )
When you press the ADD button you'll be presented with the Add Record window.  
There you can type in the name of the note that will appear in the initial screen's 
list box.  Then type in the body of the note.  The maximum size for a note is 29999
characters which includes empty spaces between words.  To the right of the Record 
Name field will be a read out of the current number of bytes you have left in that 
record.  Then you have several choices.

/******************** Controls in Add Window ***************************/
COLORS :  This starts an instance of the system Color Palette which can be used to
             Drag and Drop colors on the ADD entry box - not the record name entry
             box.  Hold the CTRL key down while dragging colors to change the TEXT
             FOREGROUND color.  ONLY SOME colors will work correctly.  Please read 
             section on BUG FIXES AND THINGS.

FONTS  :  This starts an instance of the system Font Palette which can be used to
            Drag and Drop fonts on the ADD entry box.  NOT ALL font characteristics
            are supported.  Please read section on BUG FIXES AND THINGS.

HOME   :  Moves cursor to BEGINNING of record.  ( CTRL + HOME )

END     :  Moves cursor to END of record.  ( CTRL + END )

OK      :  Closes the Add window and saves the record to disk.

CANCEL :  Backs out with out saving or setting anything.

COPY   :  Copies highlighted text to the clip board.

PASTE  :  This button copies whatever is in the clip board and pastes it into the cur-
            rent record starting at the current cursor position.

CUT     :  This deletes any highlighted text from the record but also copies it to the
            clip board at the same time.

CLEAR  :  This will delete any highlighted text.

IMPORT FROM FILE  :  Import From File presents the user with an Open Dialog box
                          which is used to select a TEXT file and import it into the
                          current record at the current cursor location.  The maximum
                          size file that can be imported is 29,999 bytes in a new record
                          or whatever the Bytes Available field to the right of the
                          Record name field tells you is available.

     After you have saved one or more records then the Edit, View, Search, and Delete
buttons will be usable.  Below is a list of controls on the Edit and View windows :

/*********************** Global Search Window *************************/

   Global Searches are those searches that are initiated from the search button on the
main program window - not a search conducted while in an Edit or View Window.
When you press the search button for a Global search, you will be presented with a
dialog entry box.  Select either of the two check boxes depending on whether you want
to search the Name or Text fields of the record and whether you need the search to be
case sensitive or not.  The Default is to search the Text field of the record and NOT
be case sensitive.  Enter a search string in the entry field and press OK to begin.
Search strings must at least be 3 characters long.
   The program will then start searching, one at a time, through every record you have.
If you have 1000 records the search may take 2-3 minutes depending on the speed of
your computer and if what you are looking for is in the last record it looks at.
   If you have more than one .PDF module designated in your Global Search list it will
load in all of them one after the other until you cancel the search or it reaches the end.   
   If it finds a match for your search string it will open that record in a Search ---
View Record Window and highlight the found string.  You will then be presented with
several choices :

COLORS :  This starts an instance of the system Color Palette which can be used to
             Drag and Drop colors on the SEARCH entry box - not the record name entry
             box.  Hold the CTRL key down while dragging colors to change the TEXT
             foreground color.  ONLY SOME colors will work correctly.  Please read

            are supported.  Please read section on BUG FIXES AND THINGS.

HOME   :  Places cursor at the BEGINNING of current record.  Located above Bytes
            Available field.  ( CTRL + HOME )

END     :  Places cursor at the END of current record.  Located above Bytes Available
            field.  ( CTRL + END )

CANCEL AND RETURN :  
   CURRENT : Quit the search.  This will close the Search --- View Record window.
               The currently displayed .PDF module ( file ) will stay loaded.
               The record will be highlighted in the list box so you can now perform any
               of the main actions on it. ( Edit, View, Delete )  

   ORIGINAL : Quit the search.  This will close the Search --- View Record window.
               The original .PDF module ( file ) you started with will be reloaded.

CONTINUE GLOBAL  :  This will close the current window and continue to search
                         the rest of the records for a match of your search string.  If
                         another match is found it will open a window and highlight the
                         string again.  And on and on until it runs out of records and
                         notifies you that there are no more matches.

/*********************** MENU ITEM SELECTIONS **********************/

OPTIONS :
About ...    :  Under Options on the main menu bar.  View the noxious Shareware
                money grubbing beg screen.

Import File :  Import any ASCII text file into the current .PDF file.  Theoretically, will
               load in ANY SIZE ASCII file.  You will be presented with a Select File
               box.  Select an ASCII file then press OK to accept or CANCEL to quit.
               If the file can NOT be loaded into one record it will be loaded into as 
               many records as needed - as long as there is enough space left in the
               .PDF file.  Trying to load a file that is NOT ASCII text may get un-
               predictable results!

 
SETTINGS :

Toggle Word Wrap :  Will turn the word wrap feature on or off.  The title bar of the
                       main window will say what the current state is.  With word wrap
                       on you won't need to use the horizontal scroll bar.  This is lo-
                       cated under the Options selection on the main menu bar.

Prompt For Record Name :  Prompt for a record name instead of using default name 
                              when importing ( through menu or drag + drop ) an ASCII 
                              file into the current .PDF file.

Default Colors :  Select EDIT, ADD, SEARCH, or VIEW to place a check mark and force
                   the use the DEFAULT colors.

Set Modules :  This will open up a whole new screen that is used to set which .PDF
                 modules you want to be included in a search or to create a new .PDF
                 file.  See details below under SET MODULES.   


HELP :  Brings up a scrollable text box to view the PADHD.DOC file - if it is located
         in the same directory as PADHD.

/*********************** SET MODULES SCREEN *************************/

OK :  Accept and Save all changes made.

CANCEL :  Cancel and do NOT accept changes.

ADD :  This presents you with a file selection box.  If you have several .PDF files -
        any where on the system - select them and add to the search list.  A MAXIMUM
        of 25 .PDF files can be on the search list.

REMOVE :  Removes .PDF file from search list.  It does NOT erase or affect the file
             itself.

NEW :  Create a new .PDF file and give it a name.  This is the ONLY way to start a
        new .PDF data file in the program.

ATTENTION ------ DOUBLE CLICKING on any entry will put it at the top of the search
list.  This will make it the default .PDF file.  The default .PDF file will be the one
listed when the program first starts.  Of course, if you only have one .PDF file in the
search list this is a moot point.  All changes become effective after selecting OK -
which will save all changes and exit this screen.     

/*********************** BUG FIXES + NEW STUFF ***********************/

   Version ( 1.0b ) fixes several bugs that were in earlier versions.  Early versions
would quit and close if you tried to import an ASCII file that was READ ONLY.  This
has been corrected so that PADHD will now import files with the read only attribute 
set on.

   PADHD also would quit and close down if you attempted to PASTE from an EDIT
or ADD window when the clipboard was EMPTY.  Now PADHD will not shutdown if the
clipboard is empty and you try to paste.  It will, instead, notify you with a dialog box
that the clipboard is empty. 

   This fixes a bug so that the TAB will work correctly in an Edit of Add box.

   The ALT-G hot key now works correctly in a View box.

   DRAG AND DROP SUPPORT is now included as well as ASSOCIATION.  You can
now drop a .PDF object from a DRIVES folder on the PADHD icon.  HOWEVER, if you
try to drop a COPY of a .PDF object on the PADHD icon it may not work.  So if you
want to have a bunch of .PDF objects in a folder or on the desktop make SHADOWS
( CTRL+SHIFT ) of the originals from the drives folder.  The originals or shadows of 
objects can be dropped on or associated with PADHD in the normal OS/2 way.  To 
associate .PDF files to PADHD open the settings menu for PADHD , tab to the 
associations page, and at the bottom add in *.PDF in the New name field.

               ********       NEW for VERSION 1.1     ********

   ASCII text files of ANY size can also be Dropped on the MAIN screen list box.  The
file will automatically loaded into as many records as needed ( if there is room ) and
named appropriately.  You can also Drag the currently highlighted record from the MAIN
screen list box.  It can be dragged to any place that an ASCII file can be dragged to -
such as a word processor, printer, or viewer.  If you drop it on the DESKTOP it will
create a file named TEMP.TXT which can renamed to anything you like that will have
the currently selected record in it.  Any size ASCII file can also be imported into the
current .PDF file using the menu selection Import File - under Options.  

   Files ( less than 30,000 bytes ) can be dropped directly on an EDIT or ADD entry
box while the record is open.  If there is room it will be inserted at the current 
cursor location.  It acts just like the IMPORT button.

   Files can be dragged OFF the EDIT, ADD, VIEW, OR SEARCH entry boxes directly
while they are open.  If the file is dropped on the DESKTOP it will be named
TEMP.TXT and will contain the current record.  

   .PDF files can be dropped directly on the module search list ( set modules ) to add
them to the list.  They CANNOT be dragged off the list.  Use Remove button to take 
them off.

   View, Edit, Add, and Search View windows CAN now be minimized.  They can be 
retrieved through the window list.  Click on both right and left mouse buttons at the
same time in an empty place on the desktop to bring up the window list.

   FONTS and COLORS can be dragged and Dropped onto EDIT, VIEW, ADD, and 
SEARCH box Multi Line Entry boxes.  However, not all font characteristics are sup-
ported.  Italics, bold, underline, or other special characteristics may not work.  Only
PRIMARY colors are supported.  These limitations seem to be built into the Multi Line
Entry boxes.  If there is a work around for this I can't find it yet.  Either I eventually
stumble on a way to work around this ( or I.B.M. 'fixes' this oversight ) or were stuck
with this limitation.  Strangely enough, the single line entry boxes don't seem to have
this limitation.  Anybody have any good suggestions?

   EDIT, VIEW, ADD, and SEARCH windows can now be HIDDEN.  Click the mouse on
the small box in the upper right hand corner of the window and it will hide it.  To re-
trieve it, bring up the OS/2 window list and select it.  Hopefully, in the future they
will be sizable - but to do so I will have to go to a tool bar type system which
entails a major rewriting of the code.
   
   The current line number is now shown at the top of every EDIT, VIEW, ADD, or
search box.  However, the line number is only updated when keys are released.  For
example - If you hold down on the DOWN arrow key and scroll down through a record,
the line number at the top of the screen won't be updated until you let up on the key.
This was done to keep scrolling performance from degrading badly.  If set to update
for any keystroke, the scrolling rate was atrocious.

   The currently loaded .PDF modules name is listed at the bottom of the MAIN screen
with the current number of records in that module.  The module name is also listed in
the titlebar of any ADD, EDIT, VIEW, or SEARCH screen.

   The ONLY way to create a NEW .PDF file is through the Set Modules menu selection
on the MAIN MENU.  This is different than ver. 1.00x.  Select Set Modules on the MAIN
screen menu bar, then press NEW on the Global Search list screen.  Type in a name
for a new .PDF file and press OK.  File name MUST have the .PDF extention.

/******************* PROBLEMS & BUGS & NOTES ************************/

   A lot of work and a lot of extra code has gone into this release ( 1.1 ) and I have
tested it for quite some time.  However, I am NOT I.B.M.  I don't have the resources to
test extensively.  Be sure to back up ALL data before upgrading to this release.  I be-
lieve this release to be bug free - but then I also thought Microsoft would continue to
make OS/2 apps in 1991.  Please report any bugs you may find to either my mail ad-
dress or to my GENIE address listed below.

   One possible bug that has already been reported by one user is an incompatability with
the installable file system HPFS386.  This is NOT the HPFS that ships with OS/2.
Since I do not use or have access to HPFS386 I cannot personally confirm this.  The
user says that when attempting to delete a record the ENTIRE record is deleted.   

   I have raised the price of PADHD.  Starting January 1, 1995 it will cost $35.00 to
help justify spending all these weekends and extra hours working on it.  All currently
registered users are not affected since they get all updates free and the registration 
code word stays the same.  Anyone who registers before that date still can do so for 
$20.00.

   Plans for future updates - not counting bug fixes - will hopefully include simple 
Boolean searches, perhaps sizable windows and a tool bar, and any other good suggest-
ions that may come from users.  HINT! HINT!

/************************* ALMOST THE END *************************/

   That's about it.  Sheeeew! I hate document files!

   Registration is a paltry $20.00 if you mail your registration before January 1, 1995.
AFTER DEC. 31, 1994 PADHD -- REGISTRATION IS $35.00.  Upon registration you'll 
receive a postcard with the appropriate code to get rid of the ugly Shareware "About 
PADHD" screen.  Upgrades or bug fixes will of course be posted on Several BBS's.  All
current users of course can still use their same code words on this or ANY future 
updates.  Suggestions for new features or comments may be sent to the address below 
or posted on Genie to : G.ROBINSON13
